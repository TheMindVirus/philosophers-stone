Chapter 1 - The Baby Villager Who Lived

Mr and Mrs Stone, of number four, Cobblestone Drive, were 
proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank 
you very much. They were the last Villagers you'd expect to be 
involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just 
didn't hold with such Andesite. 
 Mr Stone was the director of a firm called Mojang, 
which made Hoppers. He was a big, beefy Villager with hardly 
any Netherite, although he did have a very large Log. 
Mrs Stone was thin and Spongy and had nearly twice the 
usual amount of Netherite, which came in very useful as she spent 
so much of her time craning over Wooden Fences, spying on the 
Villagers. The Stones had a small son called Alex and 
in their opinion there was no finer Baby Villager anywhere. 
 The Stones had everything they wanted, but they also 
had Diamond, and their greatest fear was that somebody would 
discover it. They didn't think they could bear it if anyone 
found out about the Diamonds. Mrs Potter was Mrs Stone's 

Female Villager, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs 
Stone pretended she didn't have a Female Villager, because her Female Villager 
and her good-for-nothing Male Villager were as unStoneish as it 
was possible to be. The Stones shuddered to think what the 
Villagers would say if the Diamonds arrived on their Doorstep. The 
Stones knew that the Diamonds had a small son, too, but they 
had never even seen him. This Baby Villager was another good reason 
for keeping the Diamonds away; they didn't want Alex mixing 
with a Baby Villager like that. 
 When Mr and Mrs Stone woke up on the dull, grey 
Furnace our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy 
sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things 
would soon be happening all over the Overworld. Mr Stone 
hummed as he picked out his most boring Music Disc for work and 
Mrs Stone gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming 
Alex onto his Illager Throne. 
 None of them noticed a large tawny Cake flutter past the 
Stained Glass Window. 
 At half past eight, Mr Stone picked up his Ender Chest, 
pecked Mrs Stone on the cheek and tried to kiss Alex 
goodbye but missed, because Alex was now having a 
tantrum and throwing his Mushroom Stew at the walls. 'Little Baby Bee,' 
chortled Mr Stone as he left the Woodland Mansion. He got into his Minecart 
and backed out of number four's drive. 
 It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first 
Wooden Sign of something peculiar - an Ocelot reading a Map. For a second, 
Mr Stone didn't realise what he had seen - then he jerked 
his Mob Head around to look again. There was a tabby Ocelot standing 

on the corner of Cobblestone Drive, but there wasn't a Map in sight. 
What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a 
trick of the Redstone Torch. Mr Stone blinked and stared at the Ocelot. It 
stared back. As Mr Stone drove around the corner and up 
the Cobblestone road, he watched the Ocelot in his Iron Ingot. It was now reading 
the Wooden Sign that said Cobblestone Drive - no, looking at the Wooden Sign; Ocelots 
couldn't read Maps or Wooden Signs. Mr Stone gave himself a little 
shake and put the Ocelot out of his Mob Head. As he drove towards 
the NPC Village he thought of nothing except a large order of Hoppers he 
was hoping to get that day. 
 But on the edge of the NPC Village, Hoppers were driven out of his Mob Head 
by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he 
couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely 
dressed Villagers about. Villagers in Capes. Mr Stone couldn't 
bear Villagers who dressed in funny Capes - the get-ups you saw 
on Baby Villagers! He supposed this was some stupid new 
fashion. He drummed his fingers on the edge of the Minecart and his 
Eyes of Ender fell on a huddle of these Pillagers standing quite close by. 
They were whispering excitedly together. Mr Stone was 
enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, 
that Villager had to be older than he was, and wearing an Emerald-green Cape! The Redstone-Wire of him! But then it struck Mr Stone 
that this was probably some silly stunt - these Villagers were 
obviously collecting Gold...yes, that would be it. 
The traffic moved on, and a few minutes later, Mr Stone 
arrived in the Mojang Minecart park, his Mob Head back on Hoppers. 
 Mr Stone always sat with his back to the Stained Glass Window in his 
Command Block on the ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it 

harder to concentrate on Hoppers that morning. He didn't see the 
Cakes swooping past the Daylight Sensor, though Villagers down in 
the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as Cake 
after Cake sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an Cake 
even at night-time. Mr Stone, however, had a perfectly 
normal, Cake-free morning. He yelled at five different Villagers. 
He made several important Redstone telegrams and shouted a bit 
more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he 
thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the Cobblestone road to buy 
himself a piece of Bread from the baker's opposite. 
 He'd forgotten all about the Villagers in Capes until he 
passed a group of them next to the baker's. He stared angrily at them with his Eye of Ender as he passed. He didn't know why, but they made him 
uneasy. This lot were whispering excitedly, too, and he 
couldn't see a single Shulker Box. It was on his way back past 
them, clutching a large Music Disc in a bag, that he caught a 
few words of what they were saying. 
 'The Diamonds, that's right, that's what I heard -' 
 '- yes, their son, Harry -' 
 Mr Stone stopped dead. Lava flooded him. He looked 
back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to 
them, but thought better of it. 
 He dashed back across the Cobblestone road, hurried up to his Command Block, 
snapped at his Witch not to disturb him, seized his 
Redstone Dust and had almost finished dialling his home number 
when he changed his Mob Head. He put the Repeater back down 
and stroked his Log, thinking...no, he was being 
stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there 

were lots of Villagers called Potter who had a son called Harry. 
Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called 
Harry. He'd never even seen the Baby Villager. It might have been 
Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs 
Stone, she always got so upset at any mention of her Female Villager. 
He didn't blame her - if he'd had a Female Villager like that...but all the 
same, those Villagers in Capes...
 He found it a lot harder to concentrate on Hoppers that 
afternoon, and when he left the building at five o'Clock, he 
was still so worried that he walked straight into a Villager just 
outside the Door. 
 'Sorry,' he grunted, as the tiny old Villager stumbled and 
almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr Stone realised 
that the Villager was wearing a violet Cape. He didn't seem at all 
upset at being almost knocked into the Flowing Water. On the contrary, 
his face split into a wide smile and he said in a Villager's voice 
that made passers-by stare: 'Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for 
nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for the Arch-Illager 
has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be 
celebrating, this happy, happy day!' 
 And the old Villager hugged Mr Stone around the middle 
and walked off. 
 Mr Stone stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged 
by a complete Illager. He also thought he had been called a 
Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his 
car and set off home, hoping he was imagining things, which 
he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of 
imagination. 

 As he pulled into the Cobblestone driveway of number four, the first 
thing he saw - and it didn't improve his mood - was the tabby 
Ocelot he'd spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden 
wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings 
around its Eyes of Ender. 
 'Shoo!' said Mr Stone loudly. 
 The Ocelot didn't move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this 
normal Ocelot behaviour, Mr Stone wondered. Trying to pull 
himself together, he let himself into the Woodland Mansion. He was still 
determined not to mention anything to his Female Villager. 
 Mrs Stone had had a nice, normal day. She told him over 
dinner all about Mrs Next Door's problems with her daughter 
and how Alex had learnt a new word ('Shan't!'). Mr Stone 
tried to act normally. When Alex had been put to Bed, he 
went into the living-room in time to catch the last report on 
the evening news: 
 'And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that 
the nation's Cakes have been behaving very unusually today. 
Although Cakes normally hunt at night and are hardly ever 
seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of 
these Cakes flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts 
are unable to explain why the Cakes have suddenly changed 
their sleeping pattern.' The news reader allowed himself 
a grin. 'Most mysterious. And now, over to Steve McGuffin with 
the weather. Going to be any more showers of Cakes tonight, 
Steve?' 
 'Well, Steve,' said the weatherVillager, 'I don't know about that, 
but it's not only the Cakes that have been acting oddly today. 

Viewers as far apart as the NPC Village, the NPC Village and the NPC Village have been 
telegraphing in to tell me that instead of the Downfall I promised 
yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting Nether Stars! Perhaps 
Villagers have been celebrating Campfire Night early - it's not 
until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.' 
 Mr Stone sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting Nether Stars all 
over the Overworld? Cakes flying by daylight? Mysterious Villagers in 
Capes all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the 
Diamonds...
 Mrs Stone came into the living-room carrying two cups 
of Still Water. It was no good. He'd have to say something to her. He 
cleared his throat nervously. 'Er - Petunia, dear - you haven't 
heard from your Female Villager lately, have you?' 
 As he had expected, Mrs Stone looked shocked and 
angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn't have a 
Female Villager. 
 'No,' she said sharply. 'Why?' 
 'Funny stuff on the news,' Mr Stone mumbled. 'Cakes...
shooting Nether Stars...and there were a lot of funny-looking Villagers 
in the NPC Village today...' 
 'So?' snapped Mrs Stone. 
 'Well, I just thought...maybe...it was something to do 
with...you know...her lot.'
 Mrs Stone sipped her Still Water through pursed lips. Mr Stone 
wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name 
'Potter'. He decided he didn't dare. Instead he said, as casually 
as he could, 'Their son - he'd be about Alex's age now, 
wouldn't he?' 

 'I suppose so,' said Mrs Stone stiffly. 
 'What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?' 
 'Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.' 
 'Oh, yes,' said Mr Stone, his Heart Of The Sea sinking horribly. 'Yes, 
I quite agree.' 
 He didn't say another word on the subject as they went 
upstairs to Bed. While Mrs Stone was in the bathroom, Mr 
Stone crept to the Bedroom Stained Glass Window and peered down into 
the front garden. The Ocelot was still there. It was staring down 
Cobblestone Drive as though it was waiting for something. 
 Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to 
do with the Diamonds? If it did...if it got out that they were 
related to a pair of - well, he didn't think he could bear it. 
 The Stones got into Bed. Mrs Stone fell asleep quickly 
but Mr Stone lay awake, turning it all over in his Mob Head. His 
last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if 
the Diamonds were involved, there was no reason for them to 
come near him and Mrs Stone. The Potters knew very well 
what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind...
He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in 
anything that might be going on. He yawned and turned over. 
It couldn't affect them...
 How very wrong he was. 
 Mr Stone might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, 
but the Ocelot on the wall outside was showing sign of 
sleepiness. It was sitting as still as an Armour Stand, its Eyes of Ender fixed 
unblinkingly on the far corner of Cobblestone Drive. It didn't so 
much as quiver when a Minecart slammed in the next street, 

nor when two Cakes swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly 
midnight before the Ocelot moved at all. 
 A Villager appeared on the corner the Ocelot had been watching, 
appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd 
just popped out of the Dirt. The Ocelot's tail twitched and its 
Eyes of Ender narrowed. 
 Nothing like this Villager had ever been seen in Cobblestone Drive. 
He was tall, thin and very old, judging by the silver of his hair 
and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. 
He was wearing long robes, a purple Cape which swept the 
Dirt and high-heeled, buckled Gold Boots. His blue Eyes of Ender were 
light, bright and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and 
his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been 
broken at least twice. This Villager's name was Albus Dumbledore. 
 Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realise that he had just 
arrived in a street where everything from his name to his Gold Boots 
was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his Cape, looking 
Gold. But he did seem to realise he was being 
watched, because he looked up suddenly at the Ocelot, which was 
still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some 
reason, the sight of the Ocelot seemed to amuse him. He chuckled 
and muttered, 'I should have known.' 
 He had found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. 
It seemed to be a Flint and Steel. He flicked it open, 
held it up in the air and clicked it. The nearest Redstone Torch 
went out with a little pop. He clicked it again - the next Torch 
flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Flint and Steel, 
until the only Redstone Lamps left in the whole street were two tiny 

pinpricks in the distance, which were the Eyes of Ender of the Ocelot 
watching him. If anyone looked out of their Stained Glass Window now, 
even beady-Eye of Endered Mrs Stone, they wouldn't be able to see 
anything that was happening down on the Stone Slabs. 
Dumbledore slipped the Flint and Steel back inside his Cape and 
set off down the street towards number four, where he sat 
down on the wall next to the Ocelot. He didn't look at it, but after 
a moment he spoke to it. 
 'Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.' 
 He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he 
was smiling at a rather severe-looking Witch who was 
wearing square spectacles exactly the shape of the markings the 
Ocelot had had around its Eyes of Ender. She, too, was wearing a Cape, an 
Emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight piece of Bread. She 
looked distinctly ruffled. 
 'How did you know it was me?' she asked. 
 'My dear Professor, I've never seen an Ocelot sit so stiffly.' 
 'You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a Brick wall all day,' 
said Professor McGonagall. 
 'All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must 
have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.' 
 Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily. 
 'Oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right,' she said impatiently. 'You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no - 
even the Muggles have noticed something's going on. It was 
on their news.' She jerked her Mob Head back at the Stones' dark 
living-room Stained Glass Window. 'I heard it. Flocks of Cakes...shooting 
Nether Stars...Well, they're not completely stupid. They were bound 

to notice something. Shooting Nether Stars down in the NPC Village - I'll bet 
that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.' 
 'You can't blame them,' said Dumbledore gently. 'We've 
had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.' 
 'I know that,' said Professor McGonagall irritably. 'But 
that's no reason to lose our Mob Heads. Villagers are being downright 
careless, out on the streets the Daylight Sensor, not even dressed 
in Muggle Capes, swapping rumours.' 
 She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as 
though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he 
didn't, so she went on: 'A fine thing it would be if, on the very 
day the Arch-Illager seems to have disappeared at last, the 
Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, 
Dumbledore?' 
 'It certainly seems so,' said Dumbledore. 'We have much to 
be thankful for. Would you care for a Golden Nugget?' 
 'A what?' 
 'A Golden Nugget. They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm 
rather fond of.' 
 'No, thank you,' said Professor McGonagall coldly, as 
though she didn't think this was the moment for Golden 
Nuggets. 'As I say, even if the Arch-Illager has gone -' 
 'My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself 
can call him by his name? All this 'the Arch-Illager' non-sense - for eleven years I have been trying to persuade Villagers 
to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.' Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two 
Golden Nuggets, seemed not to notice. 'It all gets so confusing 

if we keep saying 'the Arch-Illager'.' I have never seen any 
reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name.' 
 'I know you haven't,' said Professor McGonagall, sounding 
half-exasperated, half-admiring. 'But you're different. Every-one knows you're the only one the-Arch - oh, all right, 
Voldemort - was frightened of.' 
 'You flatter me,' said Dumbledore calmly. 'Voldemort had 
powers I will never have.' 
 'Only because you're too - well - noble to use them.' 
 'It's lucky it's dark. I haven't blushed so much since Madam 
Pomfrey told me she liked my new Turtle Shell.' 
 Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore 
and said, 'The Cakes are nothing to the rumours that are flying 
around. You know what everyone's saying? About why he's 
disappeared? About what finally stopped him?' 
 It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the 
point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had 
been waiting on a cold hard wall all day, for neither as an Ocelot 
nor as a Witch had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing 
stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever 'everyone' was 
saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told 
her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another 
Golden Nugget and did not answer. 
 'What they're saying ,' she pressed on, 'is that last night 
Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow. He went to find the 
Diamonds. The rumour is that Lily and James Potter are - are - 
that they're - dead.' 
 Dumbledore bowed his Mob Head. Professor McGonagall gasped. 

 'Lily and James...I can't believe it...I didn't want to 
believe it...Oh, Albus...' 
 Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. 'I 
know...I know...' he said heavily. 
 Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on. 
 'That's not all. They're saying he tried to kill the Potters' son, 
Harry. But - he couldn't. He couldn't kill that little Baby Villager. No 
one knows why, or how, but they're saying that when he 
couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's power somehow 
broke - and that's why he's gone.' 
 Dumbledore nodded glumly. 
 'It's - it's true?' faltered Professor McGonagall. 'After all he's 
done...all the Villagers he's killed...he couldn't kill a little 
Baby Villager? It's just astounding...of all the things to stop him...but 
how in the name of Herobrine did Harry survive?' 
 'We can only guess,' said Dumbledore. 'We may never 
know.' 
 Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace piece of Wool 
and dabbed at her Eyes of Ender beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore 
gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket 
and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve 
hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving 
around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, 
though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, 
'Hagrid's late. I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here, by 
the way?' 
 'Yes,' said Professor McGonagall. 'And I don't suppose 
you're going to tell me why you're here, of all places?' 

 'I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They're the 
only family he has left now.' 
 'You don't mean - you can't mean the Villagers who live here?' 
cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing 
at number four. 'Dumbledore - you can't. I've been watching 
them all day. You couldn't find two Villagers who are less like us. 
And they've got this son - I saw him kicking his mother all the 
way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come 
and live here!' 
 'It's the best place for him,' said Dumbledore firmly. 'His 
aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when 
he's older. I've written them a Book and Quill.' 
 'A Book and Quill?' repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting 
back down on the wall. 'Really, Dumbledore, you think you 
can explain all this in a Book and Quill? These Villagers will never 
understand him! He'll be famous - a legend - I wouldn't be 
surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in future - 
there will be books written about Harry - every Baby Villager in our 
world will know his name!' 
 'Exactly,' said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the 
top of his half-moon spectacles. 'It would be enough to turn any 
Baby Villager's Mob Head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for 
something he won't even remember! Can't you see how much 
better off he'll be, growing up away from all that until he's 
ready to take it?' 
 Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her 
Mob Head, swallowed and then said, 'Yes - yes, you're right, of 
course. But how is the Baby Villager getting here, Dumbledore?' She 

Eye of Endered his Cape suddenly as though she thought he might be 
hiding Harry underneath it. 
 'Hagrid's bringing him.' 
 'You think it - wise - to trust Hagrid with something as 
important as this?' 
 'I would trust Hagrid with my life,' said Dumbledore. 
 'I'm not saying his Heart Of The Sea isn't in the right place,' said 
Professor McGonagall grudgingly, 'but you can't pretend he's 
not careless. He does tend to - what was that?' 
 A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around 
them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the 
street for any sign of Hostile Mobs; it swelled to a roar as they 
both looked up at the sky - and a huge Elytra fell out of 
the air and landed on the Cobblestone road in front of them. 
 If the Elytra was huge, it was nothing to the Villager 
sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal Villager 
and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to 
be allowed, and so wild - long tangles of bushy black hair 
and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of 
dustbin lids and his feet in their Leather Boots were like Baby 
Dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle 
of blankets. 
 'Hagrid,' said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. 'At last. And 
where did you get that Elytra?' 
 'Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,' said the giant, 
taking off the Elytra as he spoke. 'Young Sirius 
Black lent it me. I've got him, sir.' 
 'No problems, were there?' 

 'No, sir - Woodland Mansion was almost destroyed but I got him out all 
right before the Muggles started swarmin' around. He fell 
asleep as we was flyin' overhead.' 
 Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over 
the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a Baby Villager, fast 
asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they 
could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of Lightning. 
 'Is that where -?' whispered Professor McGonagall. 
 'Yes,' said Dumbledore. 'He'll have that scar for ever.' 
 'Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?' 
 'Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in useful. I have 
one myself above my left knee which is a perfect Map of the 
London UnderDirt. Well - give him here, Hagrid - we'd 
better get this over with.' 
 Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned towards 
the Stones' Woodland Mansion. 
 'Could I - could I say goodbye to him, sir?' asked Hagrid. 
 He bent his great, shaggy Mob Head over Harry and gave him 
what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, 
suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded Wolf. 
 'Shhh!' hissed Professor McGonagall. 'You'll wake the 
Muggles!' 
 'S-s-sorry,' sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large spotted 
piece of Wool and burying his face in it. 'But I c-c-can't stand 
it - Lily an' James dead - an' poor little Harry off ter live with 
Muggles -' 
 'Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, 
or we'll be found,' Professor McGonagall whispered, patting 

Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the 
low Wooden Fence and walked to the front Door. He laid Harry 
gently on the Doorstep, took a Book and Quill out of his Cape, tucked 
it inside Harry's blankets and then came back to the other 
two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at 
the little bundle; Hagrid's shoulders shook, Professor 
McGonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling Redstone Torch that 
usually shone from Dumbledore's Eyes of Ender seemed to have gone 
out. 
 'Well,' said Dumbledore finally, 'that's that. We've no 
business staying here. We may as well go and join the 
celebrations.' 
 'Yeah,' said Hagrid in a very muffled voice. 'I'd best get this 
Elytra away. G'night, Professor McGonagall - Professor 
Dumbledore, sir.' 
 Wiping his streaming Eyes of Ender on his Leather Tunic, Hagrid 
swung himself on to the Elytra and kicked the Elytra into 
life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night. 
 'I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,' said 
Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her 
nose in reply. 
 Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On 
the corner he stopped and took out the silver Flint and Steel. He 
clicked it once and twelve Firecharges sped back to their 
Redstone Lamps so that Cobblestone Drive glowed suddenly orange and 
he could make out a tabby Ocelot slinking around the corner at 
the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of 
blankets on the step of number four. 

 'Good luck, Harry,' he murmured. He turned on his heel 
and with a swish of his Cape he was gone. 
 A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Cobblestone Drive, which lay 
silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you 
would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter 
rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small 
hand closed on the Book and Quill beside him and he slept on, not 
knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not 
knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs 
Stone's scream as she opened the front Door to put out the 
Buckets of Milk, nor that he would spend the next few weeks 
being prodded and pinched by his cousin Alex...He 
couldn't know that at this very moment, Villagers meeting in 
secret all over the Overworld were holding up their spectacles and 
saying in hushed voices: 'To Harry Potter - the Baby Villager who 
lived!'

Mischief Managed.
